- Views are case-sensitive but we're currently smashing everything into
  lowercase so that users can type in case insensitively
- Redirects for the API are not recognised by the http client so we're still
  looking up the wrong URI of our job views. To solve this we can either remove
  the requirement for all views to be indexed by an initial server lookup, or
  handle the error case better. The UI would still be a little bit broken
  because the View selector would show an empty view, and the currently
  selected view would not be in its list.
- Jenkins servers often run on https:// for web-browsers but force http:// for
  api clients. This often results in us not finding views because we're not
  looking up the correct protocol of the URI.
